This package contains a compilation of batch scripts which allow the user to manage their DayZServer installation, almost effortlessly. 

You will require some basic understanding of your system, file structure, and how to navigate or obtain information for any mods installed on your server, in order to properly configure these files to be used on your server. 

These files do use discord webhooks as a means for better project development. 
The information sent to our discord by the webhooks are simply script titles, and non server identifiable script related details.
We do not transfer or send any system related details. 
The webhooks allow us to assist with configuration related issues, where such assistance is asked of us on our discord.   

Futher project development is underway to improve upon this script.

Future release of this project aims to offer some impressive "game changers" with regards to dayzserver installation, and administraiton automation,

Join our discord to be a part of our development, support needs, or to enquire further information.
