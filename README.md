This GumZMumZ package contains a combination of batch scripts and other configurable process required documents which (when configured properly) allow the user to put in place a nearly effortless method to manage their DayZServer maintenance, DayZServer installation, and Server Mod updates/maintenance. 

This package on it's own without any tutorials or explaining does require that the user has some basic understanding of networking, file structure, comprehending code or computer language, and how to navigate or obtain information related to their steam account as well as compile basic information pertaining to any of the mods they have or would like to have installed on their game server.

As is, with this combination of scripts (configured correctly) you may likely never need to manually update your server if you are simply running a personal dev system or a low pop server, and your server would most likely NEVER be out of service for more than the duration you have configured for scheduled restarts (2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 38.5 minutes... whatever you decide)

This script is simple. 
Did I mention the installation process of this script is incredibly simple. 
These scripts do not currently offer any user interface. 
These scripts would best suited a personal server, a development server, but these scripts can also easily serve the needs of a gaming server with constant Que as long as you keep an eye to mod updates or core updates, and then initiate the server restart manually so all new players can still gain access. 

It would be great if you are are familiar with working sys-admin, coding and/or scripts... BUT this script can be installed by anyone in less than 10 minutes (personal knowledge, network & and system resources permitting)

The next update will offer 
~ Better monitoring practices
~ Automatic GAME SERVER restarts on repo update. 
~ Customizable webhooks to keep admin up to date. 
++ much more.
