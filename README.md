This package contains batch scripts which allow the user to manage their DayZServer installation, almost effortlessly once configured properly. 

User will require some basic understanding of systems, code, file structure, and how to navigate or obtain information for any of the mods installed on their game server.    

As is, with this combination of scripts (configured correctly) you would likely never need to manually update your server and it would most likely NEVER be out of service for more than however long you set for your scheduled restarts. 

The next update will offer way more stability, and more ensured update dependablity.   

These scripts do not offer any user interface.
They would be best suited for a personal, community, or game server that is managed and maintained by individuals that are familiar with working sys-admin, coding and/or scripts.

There will be an update to these scripts in the coming week. 

The next release of this project will consist of starting a batch file which will continue to manage, monitor, and update the server with extremely low need for manual intervention.
